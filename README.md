A proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection for a multivariate building dataset.

## Abstract:

Ubiquitous devices employed in building facilities are allowing us to acquire a diverse amount
of data relative to the internal systems of buildings. This is contributing to the growing awareness 
of the gap that exists between the desired performance of a building and its actual performance. 
Automated fault detection and diagnostic (AFDD) systems have been showed to be effective at detecting 
the root cause of performance problems. This master thesis is interested in finding motif cluster 
(typical patterns) and discord clusters (atypical/abnormal patterns), two types of patterns used 
by some AFDD approaches. Our approach attains to discover daily patterns in a multivariate fashion 
for a studied building dataset by using the Gaussian Hidden Markov models. The discovered motif cluster 
profiles define the typical performance of the building, while the discovered discord cluster profiles 
spot potential performance problems of the building. Three proposed models create a label data frame 
that summarize all the daily patterns in a table allowing the researcher to do further aggregation 
about the motif/discord cluster profiles. The proposed models where tested in a case study where the North-East and
South-West ventilation systems of the studied building were compared. The results provide
information about the pattern evolution across different seasons and years, as well as the dy-
namics between various variables. In addition, anomalous daily profiles were spotted as a
multivariate pattern in the North-East ventilation system, that demonstrate how powerful this
approach is. Finally, this approach had good feedback from the building experts and the po-
tential of our approach motivates further research.
